It seems that Bazel is mistakenly caching test results even if symlinks change. 
To repro:

- clone this repo
- `bazel test //playground:test` -- it should fail
- uncomment line 6 in //playground/BUILD
- `bazel test //playground:test` -- Bazel will notice that things have changed 
and rebuild/rerun the test and it should pass
- comment line 6 in //playground/BUILD
- `bazel test //playground:test` -- Bazel will use the prior cached test result
even though this symlink should now be gone.
